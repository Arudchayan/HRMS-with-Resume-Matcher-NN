## Human Resource Management System

The Human Resource Management System (HRMS) is a comprehensive project developed as part of our Information Technology Project (ITP) group project. It aims to streamline various aspects of human resource management within an organization. The system incorporates several modules, including employee management, payroll management, training and development management, job vacancy management, transport management, leave and attendance management, and resource management.

### Modules
1. **Employee Management** (by Zaqwan Zulficar): This module handles employee-related tasks such as employee profiles, personal information, employment history, and performance records.

2. **Payroll Management** (by Abdul Azeez Irfan): The payroll management module automates salary calculations, tax deductions, benefits administration, and generates payslips for employees.

3. **Training and Development Management** (by Isuru Akalanka): This module manages employee training programs, tracks skill development initiatives, schedules training sessions, and monitors employee progress.

4. **Job Vacancy Management:** (by Arudchayan) As part of this project, I took the responsibility of developing the job vacancy management module. This module facilitates the hiring process within the organization. I implemented a resume matching feature using Python, which involved creating a neural network trained on a dataset of CVs. This neural network effectively matches job requirements with candidate resumes, simplifying the hiring process and improving efficiency.This module is a holistic solution with a job posting and applying features allowing for a sophisticated solution that meets the needs of this scope.

5. **Transport Management** (by Mayuran Ganeshalingam): This module manages transportation arrangements for employees, including tracking transportation requests, assigning vehicles, and maintaining transport schedules.

6. **Leave and Attendance Management** (by Sajeevan Sivapalan): The leave and attendance management module handles employee attendance records, leave applications, approval workflows, and tracks leave balances.

7. **Resource Management** (by Mohomed Akmal Alavi): This module tracks and manages organizational resources such as equipment, tools, and facilities. It includes allocation, availability tracking, and maintenance schedules.

### Technologies Used

The HRMS project is developed using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB:** A flexible and scalable NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Express:** A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust backend infrastructure.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for developing the frontend of the HRMS system.
- **Node.js:** A runtime environment that enables server-side execution of JavaScript code.
- **Python:** I utilized Python to implement the resume matching feature in the Job Vacancy Management module. By training a neural network on a dataset of CVs, the system can effectively match job requirements with candidate resumes, simplifying and automating the hiring process.
